    <h1 class="hey">About me and why i chose this course</h1>
    <p>My name is Lucky, and I am 19 years old. I was interested in technology and its applications in every walk of our lives at a very tender age. 
        From tinkering around different devices to spending hours mastering computer programs, I was interested in learning how everything was happening in the background. 
        This interest soon developed in a keen interest in technology, more precisely in the computer aspect.</p>

    <p>As I explored more in the world of technology, I also developed interest in systems of software and hardware. This interest took my studies to university to pursue a course in Computer Engineering. 
        I chose to pursue this course of studies because it is a wonderful amalgamation of computer science and electrical engineering that allows one to get a complete picture of systems working at software as well as hardware levels. 
        This is of extreme importance in tackling challenges that technology presents to our lives in our times.</p>
        
    <p>Computer Engineering is a dynamic branch of science that keeps evolving, and it is a branch of immense potential. The branch that I am most interested in is working on new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Internet of Things. 
        Such technologies carry immense potential to control the direction of our lives in the times to come, and I am eager to be a part of it. However, my dream is to be a specialist in cybersecurity, something that has become a defining aspect of our digital era. 
        With a spate of cyber attacks unfolding around the globe and a need to secure key information, a course in Computer Engineering will equip me technical know-how to be a proficient Cybersecurity Analyst.</p>
        
    <p>learning system architecture, networks, and security protocols during my studies, I would be acquiring a technical background that would be highly beneficial to me in my professional career in cybersecurity.
         As I move ahead in pursuing this career, I am eager to work on real-life security challenges, safeguard sensitive data, and help companies to protect themselves against increasingly common cyber attacks.
         I am sure that in the long run, studying Computer Engineering would not only provide me with technical knowledge to be a professional in cybersecurity, but also provide me with problem-solving skills to be ahead in this evolving profession. 
         With my interest in technology and studying systems, I would be a productive and inventive Cybersecurity Analyst.</p>
